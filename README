Overview:

The Surfpack library provides a collection of surface fitting methods and a 
quality-of-fit metrics that can be used to quantify the error in the resulting 
approximations.  Currently supported data-fitting algorithms include least-squares 
linear regression, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), Kriging 
interpolation, artificial neural networks, and radial basis function networks.  
These algorithms are available both as a C++ library and as a standalone program 
with a simple shell interface.

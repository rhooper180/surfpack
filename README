Overview.

The Surfpack library provides a collection of surface fitting methods and a quality-of-fit metrics that can be used to quantify the error in the resulting approximations.  Currently supported data-fitting algorithms include least-squares linear regression, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), Kriging interpolation, artificial neural networks, and radial basis function networks.  These algorithms are available both as a C++ library and as a standalone program with a simple shell interface.

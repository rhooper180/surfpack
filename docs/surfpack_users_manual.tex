\section {Overview}\label{sec:overview}
Surfpack is a collection of surface-fitting methods and metrics to evaluate or predict the quality of the generated surfaces.  The concept of creating a global approximation or ``fit'' from a collection of data samples is utilized in many scientific disciplines, but the nomenclature varies widely from field to field.  The results fromthe application of such methods are commonly called empirical models, response surfaces, surrogate models, function approximations, or neural networks.  Many different algorithms have been developed and used to generalize from a set of data; these algorithms have different strengths and weaknesses.  The goals of Surfpack are

\begin{itemize}
\item 1. to give users the option to use any of several methods, depending on the nature of the specific application; and
\item 2. to put data-fitting methods that are commonly used in various disciplines into a common framework, where their properties can be more easily compared and analyzed.
\end{itemize}

With this end in mind\ldots

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Troubleshooting}
\subsection{Windows and Macintosh}

\section{Getting Started}
\subsection{Data file format}\label{sec:format}

\begin{itemize}
\item First line: number of points
\item Second line: dimensionality of data set
\item Third line: number of response values
\end{itemize}

The rest of the lines contain the points themselves, one point per
line.  For the first three lines, Surfpack ignores everything after
the first value, so it is permissible to add some explanation about
the variables.

\subsection{\textup{Examples}}\label{sec:example}


\subsubsection{Example: Timing Data}
\subsubsection{Example: Topology }
\subsubsection{Example: Rosenbrock}

\subsection{Modes of Use}
\begin{itemize}
\item As an interactive command-line program
\item As a standalone program through shell scripts
\item Through Dakota
\item As a library
\end{itemize}

\section{Catalog of Surfpack Commands}\label{sec:commands}
\subsection{Conventions}

Surfpack commands consist of a (capitalized command name followed by a
comma-delimited list of arguments in square brackets \texttt{[]}.
Whitespace is ignored.


\subsection{Command Arguments}\label{sec:arguments}

Each argument has the following format: \texttt{argument\_name =
  argument\_value}.  An argument name is an identifier--a letter
followed by a combination of letters, digits, and underscores.  An
\texttt{argument\_value} may be an identifier, an integer or
real-valued number, a string literal (enclosed in single quotes ''),
or a tuple (a comma-separated list of numbers enclosed in parenthesis,
e.g. \texttt{(1.0,3.5,4.0)}.  Arguments may appear in any order.

\section{Surfpack Library API}
Brief explanation for writing custom C++ code and linking against the Surfpack library.

\section{Using Surfpack with Dakota}
Brief explanation of how Surfpack fits in with Dakota.  Pointer to Dakota manuals for detailed information about accessing the various options.

\section{Extending Surfpack}
\subsection{Adding a new surface method}
\subsection{Adding a goodness-of-fit metric}
\subsection{Adding a new command-line option}

\section{Troubleshooting}
List of error messages with probable causes and suggestions for resolving them.
